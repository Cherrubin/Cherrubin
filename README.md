Hi there!I'm junior data scientist passionate about turning data into actionable insights. I enjoy exploring datasets, building predictive models, and communicating results clearly.
I'm currently learning and applying data science techniques across real-world datasets.
I'm expanding my knowledge in :
- Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised)
- Data visualization and storytelling with data
- Feature engineering and model evaluation
- Data preprocesing and cleaning
